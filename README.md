# SphynxScript
SphynxScript is an scripting language written in C++, designed to be simple, efficient, lightweight, and customizeable.

SphynxScript is currently run standalone, but I intend to add support for embedding scripts in C++ soon.

SphynxScript should be seen as a mix of JavaScript, Ruby, and GDScript.

More information coming soon
