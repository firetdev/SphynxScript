# Examples
To run an example, you'll first need to compile the source code for the interpreter (g++ main.cpp).

Then, select your example script, and move it into the same directory as the compiled executable.
Rename the example to "script.sph", which is the file the interpreter looks for.

## Syntax: end vs bracket
Designing SphynxScript gave me the freedom to make a programming that can be whatever I want it to be. 
I've decided to turn that freedom into the language's main philosophy. 
Therefore, there are two options for syntax: "end" and "brackets". The default is "end". The two folders here are the same examples,
but different syntaxes.

If you'd like to use a style other than "end" (currently only "brackets"), you have to define the style at the top of the file, as is
done in the examples. This only requires one line:

`STYLE = "brackets"`
